\section*{Status of Research to Date}
At this point, the major body of my research in systemizing glyph design is complete. In the first year, much of my time was spent reading the literature on glyphs in general, and perception literature detailing how the human visual system works. This work was capped by a paper showing the first systematic way of creating glyphs and was presented at IEEE VisWeek in 2012 and published in IEEE TVCG \cite{Maguire:2012:TVCG}. 

In the second year, I contributed to a number of glyph papers including a survey of the domain \cite{Borgo:2013:EG} and a piece of work on the use of glyphs for visualizing how poems are read \cite{CGF:Abd2013a}. The more extensive piece of work was based on the IEEE VisWeek \cite{Maguire:2012:TVCG} paper that proposed an approach for the compression of common regions of workflows, with the use of automatically generated glyphs to represent those compressed regions. This work was presented at IEEE VIS (renamed from VisWeek) in 2013 and published in IEEE TVCG \cite{maguire13}. 

In the third and current year, I've been working on two major pieces of work. The first is the compression of common regions (motifs) in time series data using glyphs. This is backed by a visual analytics approach to help users in tuning the parameters of the algorithm used to find these common regions. This work has been submitted for IEEE VIS 2014 and is awaiting a response \cite{maguire14}. Additionally, I have contributed significantly to another paper on creating an approach to design glyphs that are visually distinct from each other using a 'quasi hamming distance' metric. This work has also been submitted to IEEE VIS 2014 \cite{legg14}. Additionally, two are to appear in the EuroVis 2014 Proceedings as short papers: the first a collaboration with a member of the visualization group at Oxford on poem visualization and the use of animated glyphs to represent turbulence of sound when the poem is read \cite{CGF:abdul-rahman14-sp}; and the second presents the use of glyphs to aid interpretation of sequence logos, used to determine conserved regions of protein or DNA sequences \cite{CGF:maguire14-sp}.

\section*{Thesis Organization}
Following the Introduction (Chapter 1) and Related Work (Chapter 2) based largely on \cite{Borgo:2013:EG}, the thesis is organized in to five main chapters: Chapter 3 on the outline of strategies for systematic glyph creation; Chapter 4 on the creation of glyphs using a taxonomy-based approach (based on \cite{Maguire:2012:TVCG}); Chapter 5 on the visual compression of workflow visualizations using glyphs with an automated approach for the creation of those glyphs (based on \cite{maguire13}); Chapter 6 on the compression of time series visualizations with automatically created glyphs (based on \cite{maguire14}); and Chapter 7 on the creation of separable glyphs using a quasi-hamming distance-based approach (based on \cite{legg14}). Finally, in Chapter 8 the  contributions of the thesis are summarized and future work is discussed. \bigskip
